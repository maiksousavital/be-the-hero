# be-the-hero is an application that ongs can subscribe and report incidents so people interested in helping can choose
one or more incidents and contact the ong(s) to provide help.

To build this app I used some packages as folow:

- BACKEND
  - Nodemon
  - Knex query builder
  - Crypto to generate randon ONG_ID 
  - CORS to prevent the application to be accessed from outside its domain
 
- FRONTEND
  - SITE - React
  
  - MOBILE - React Native
